# Background
Web3 creates network effects say it is ENS community, NFT communities or DAOs. It creates borderless communities and allows inclusiveness in its structure. If you leave Instagram, Twitter or Tiktok today, you are going to leave your whole network of followers with the platform. Web3 changes this to take your network forward even if you want to leave the platform. We have built a solution to onboard web2 users into the web3 world without much hassle.
